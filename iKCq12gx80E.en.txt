hopefully I think they can hear you now  okay great cool good all right so let me  do that intro again so we're talking  about note-taking and we're talking  about why it's better to write list  notes why writing lots of notes is not  good for you it reduces not only  efficiency but also your quality of  learning and why most people will write  lots and lots and lots of notes and that  is incredibly detrimental to the  learning process and how and why we  should write as the title says ten times  list notes no matter what you're  studying really this this account this  is if you are in high school doing you  know high school subjects if you are in  pre-med at doing biology science if you  are studying law accounting economics  finance whatever you're studying even if  you're learning a skill if you think you  want to write notes you should be  writing a lot less and these are the  reasons why so the reason that we write  notes in the first place is so that we  can learn something right that's the  basic principle but actually  we are so used to writing notes that we  are no longer writing notes in order to  learn we end up writing notes in order  to study but studying doesn't always  equal learning and so if you're  highlighting a page and you're  highlighting and you're highlighting and  then the question is like why why are  you bothering to highlight well because  it's just what you always do or helps  you like go back to it at a later time  and it's like okay so why are you doing  something to help you go back to at a  later time instead of just doing  something that's gonna help you learn it  to begin with right so what we want to  do is take the direct shortest line to  meaningful learning as quickly as  possible because if you know it in your  head you don't need to even write the  notes the purpose is to know it not to  write the notes and so the danger is  that when you write lots and lots of  notes you have this illusion of learning  you think you're learning when actually  you haven't learned anything which is  why most people when they finish writing  their notes they probably only know 10  to 20 percent of the stuff that they  wrote so it's like okay congratulations  you spent like four hours writing these  notes and three and a half of those  hours were completely useless in the  learning process all the learning is  gonna happen later now some people will  say well the act of reading and writing  it actually helps me learn know the act  of reading and writing doesn't help you  learn we know that because if you just  turn your brain off and copy/paste  something like if you're just copying  out a line again and again you can do  that without thinking at all it's just a  motor movement all you have to do is  read it recognize and then send it  straight out again and it it doesn't  actually have to go through any part of  your brain that is processing it in a  meaningful way so the learning happens  when you actually think about it and  when it goes to other areas of the brain  so think about that when you're reading  and writing the learning you do feel  that occurs is actually occurring by  accident it only occurs because that  thought happens to escape the pathway  that you have set for it and go out  somewhere and associate with other areas  maybe cross hemispheres  and it's processed in a secondary way  and then it is expressed back up in the  writing so all I'm saying is spend less  time making it going from reading to  writing and spend more time going from  reading to thinking and connecting and  processing and then stay there do that  for longer and then once you've  understood it then write it and what  you'll end up writing naturally will be  much less that what you needed to write  at the beginning right so I'm just  saying learn first and then write rather  than read write read write read write  accidentally learn and then go over it  again you know dozens of times in order  to just smash it into your brain through  repetition right so so we're pretty  clear on that and by the way for anyone  that's watching obviously as usual if  you have questions leave them in the  comments leave them quickly because  there's a minute delay between when you  leave the comment versus when I see it  I'm sorry  between me saying something and the  common actually coming up so that's the  basic theory from you guys perspectives  what are the sort of challenges or  issues that you feel was trying to apply  that in in real life for me personally  and I know I don't know if it's the same  for Nesta I think it's that I know deep  down that writing notes is probably not  the most efficient way but in the first  place it has always worked for me so  it's kind of more challenging to trick  myself or like to get myself to do and  I'll do it another way  plus it's more so I think a confidence  problem because I don't I feel like if I  haven't put hours of work in or if I  don't have something right in front of  me to refer to that like I haven't  really done anything or that I'm not  gonna be able to learn or remember it or  even recall it I'm not sure what it is  for Nestor but that's kind of what it is  for me yeah I don't know I think I've  just met in the past just written a lot  of notes and so that's what I feel  comfortable with but I do kind of know  that deep down it's not that effective  but it's just what I feel most come  a birth but I know that learning should  sometimes make you feel uncomfortable  otherwise you're not learning yeah  actually it's it's more than just that  it's actually learning should pretty  much always make you feel pretty  uncomfortable at this Comfort is  actually the learning so if you're  learning something and it feels really  comfortable then you're probably not  actually using your brain in a very  active way that's actually that you know  that confusion in that chaos that comes  with having something that you don't  understand and trying to frantically  figure it out that is actually vital  like you should be seeking that at every  opportunity so you guys I kind of talked  about the same thing I've always done it  that worked before and therefore it's  comfortable and I don't want to change  even though deep down I kind of know so  let's break that down into the it's  worked before it's comfortable and the  deep down pot so it's worked before so  in what situation hasn't worked before  so let me ask you like are you able to  study for like are you able to study a  lecture like a one-hour lecture in one  hour and get a plus from it no I don't  think so  working very well for you is it then  well compared to what I've always been  doing it's the same so it's like yeah I  spent three hours that this is what I  expect for myself and then I can do well  with it which I know is inefficient but  I still continue to do it anyway yeah so  when are you actually doing getting the  learning done so after you finish  writing everything how much of that do  you actually know probably a lot I think  even when I describe it to friends I  always say like just because I've  written notes doesn't mean I know it  like I say that regularly so I kind of  know that writing yeah I feel like  writing notes is like you're making  something to study off if that makes  yeah when there's actually in front of  you yeah you're not learning it you're  just like making something so it's  easier for future you to study yeah  which doesn't make  a lot of sense because you're creating a  system that you know is wasting time so  in the time it takes you to write your  notes and not have learnt it I will have  already learnt it and then double the  amount and then so later when you go to  learn it I will still know it and you  will now be learning it so it's just  there's there's no difference it's like  would you rather learn it now would you  rather learn it later  except waste a lot of time now it's like  saying like okay you've got $100 to  spend would you rather spend $100 and  then get $200 back or would you rather  spend $100 and then get nothing back and  then it's been another hundred dollars  and then get $100 back it's like one of  them just doesn't make any sense to do  the other one is like a no-brainer  decision so if if you're writing and  you're like imagine that you are like  imagine any other skill right think of  your hobby and imagine a particular  technique was in that hobby okay and  let's say that you you can pull it off  10 to 20 percent of the time would you  say that you that that's working well  for you you're probably a beginner can  flips into 20 yeah so if you're reading  and writing nodes and by the end of that  writing process you've only learned 10  to 20 percent of it and honestly for  some people 20 percent is a stretch and  that's what you end up with at the very  end that's that's not called working  that means that your standards have  dropped so low that you just don't even  realize that it's not working  it's like communism like you have so  little that you think you've got  everything but you just don't know that  you could have a lot more so think about  this imagine that you you have a lecture  and that lecture is one hour okay you  spend 10 minutes before the lecture and  then after the lecture at the as soon as  the lecture ends you have a 50%  understanding of the topic  okay and then you spend an additional  hour studying the lecture and by then if  you said it if he's had a test you'd get  an A to A plus okay but the thing is  it's never gonna happen with the you  know current sort of way that you're  doing things and the reason is because  of the second point which is that's  comfortable so number one you think it  works but it doesn't work what you think  is that it not it's not different to  before the difference is that it never  worked it might have worked back in high  school when it's so easy that you can  just do whatever the hell you want you  can just not study at all and that will  still work for you but it doesn't work  when things are actually legitimately  challenging so it doesn't work or it  works by shoveling a lot of time into it  and then you get this crappy little  smidgen of a result out but it's  comfortable comfort means it's automatic  cuff amines it's something that you're  very used to so you're probably not  gonna be able to get any more efficient  using that system no matter how hard you  try your current system without changing  it in a big way is probably you already  reached the limit of that current way of  studying so that kind of yeah I'd love  for that to happen that there will be  just a dream if you don't actually make  the changes necessary to do it so  there's there's no possible option so  you either make the decision of I'd  rather be more efficient at studying  what rather just be comfortable yeah I  think that's also another part of the  issue which is just like it seems like  it's gonna take like I know that my  current note-taking takes a lot of time  but it also seems like learning a new  way to study is going to take a lot of  time as well and at the end of it I'm  not gonna know if it's worked or not so  I'm just like why don't I just stick  with this even though that's a very  short-sighted way of thinking it is a  very sad way but think about it this way  it's like you could spend time to learn  something now and struggle and then  eventually get good at a  and then succeed or you could spend time  struggling now and then never get any  result and then just forever struggle  until your standards get so low that you  just don't care anymore and then you  give up what you want to do it like I  mean you're gonna make that decision  that's a tough one I like I know what  the right decision is but that's with  the discomfort and like the fear comes  in and like the lack of confidence I'm  able to make that change which is what  my like the biggest issue is because I  think most students know deep down like  note-taking isn't useful like you don't  feel like you've learned anything after  you feel like you've got a resource to  study from but you haven't actually  learnt anything but it's just like that  process of shifting is a bit it feels  unsafe like you I'm just upgrading my  stripe account because I just realized  that it's on a limit so give me one  second for me to just do that real quick  all kind of few people commented I'm and  I will look at the comments in a second  as why and I will I will address what  you've just said about that confidence  and everything as well  hey Katie  sorry about the delay  okay great so and the stream will have  just shut down but don't worry about  that it's gonna come back real soon  I mean it still seems like it's life to  me that's just the on their nose oh I've  grade my accounts so just fixing that  yeah I was like I'm pouring my heart out  to you Justin oh look at this look at  the camera what are you what are you  doing okay  okay okay so read that okay we're back  so you're talking about confidence and  not having the confidence to do it so  are we on the sort of same page that we  do need to change it and it's worth  changing and that even if it's difficult  it's part you know it is something that  actually will be worthwhile to change  yeah but we just it's like the intention  get right actually and then like how  should we change I guess yeah so both  become the sort of same thing so you can  you can push the boundary in a safe can  you know there's two ways that you go  about it you either make big changes  with high risk or you make small changes  with low risk depending on your  personality type so if you're happy to  just screw it and just you know flip  everything and then take a big risk  changing it in a big way and this is  what I'll do with coaching because we  can just supervise but if you especially  if you're doing it solo the risk is  probably so high doing it that way  you're probably gonna do it so wrong  that you will just end up reverting back  to what you were doing before which is  why often people will say like oh I  tried this technique and it didn't work  for me and it's like no you did the  technique wrong which is why I didn't  work for you  if you did a writer would work so  there's a few different steps that I  would outline the first is just take  your notes and just just try to reduce  the number of words that's just the  first step simply try to reduce the  number of words just get into the habit  of not needing to write out full words  or full sentences and just break that  idea of kind of like  perfect sentences and perfect paragraphs  and get more in tune with the idea of  perfect learning so be less focused on  how much of my variety how many hours am  i spending be more in tune with the idea  of how much learning is occurring right  now  and that needs to become very  uncomfortable when you're studying and  you're realizing that your efficiency of  learning is really low that you've been  writing for the last hour and you've  learnt almost nothing that needs to  become very dissatisfying and  uncomfortable and cause you anxiety  because that's gonna push you to  continually change to be more efficient  so if you're obsessed with oh my god  look how beautiful this says hashtag  study Graham and then that's what your  idea of like good learning is and then  you set the test and you're getting like  class average by doing 10 times the  amount that everyone else has been  studying then that needs to be the  objective reality it's like I am right  now funneling time into the abyss and  not I'm not gonna get any of it back I'm  never gonna get this time back right  well think about all those hobbies that  you would want to do or that you have to  give up or like people that you could  spend time with so socialize and all the  things that you're sacrificing because  you suck at studying and that needs to  make you uncomfortable so work on that  first building discomfort by calibrating  to things that actually matter not with  arbitrary hours or number of nodes but  what's real learning and then start  reducing the amount of notes the second  step is delay the note-taking process if  normally you'd read a few sentences and  write notes read a paragraph and write  notes read two paragraphs and write  notes and just continue to push that out  until you don't feel the need to write  notes as much and you're more  comfortable thinking about things in  your head and you're more comfortable  with just kind of a sort of conflict  resolution conceptually thinking about  things figuring out how things make  sense and how they fit into place how  that works inside your head first and  then express your new understanding on  your notes alright so that's the second  step so the first step is simply  calibrating discomfort and then just  getting used to reducing words using  shorthand and symbols and things like  that and then the next step is just  delaying the onset of note-taking to a  little bit after you have thought about  it and just can continually think about  a little bit more and a bit more and a  bit more in a bit more and you want to  calibrate that to your sense of  discomfort so normally you might read  and you might be uncomfortable with not  writing notes at a certain point just  tell yourself okay I'm just gonna read a  little bit more and then I'll write my  notes and then stay at that level and  then push it a little bit I'm gonna read  a little bit more and just continually  push that it will be slow but  sustainable progress and eventually you  should be able to read pretty much an  entire lick show without needing to  write notes and then you'll think about  it you'll learn most of the content in  your head and in your right and now this  is incredibly important because later on  especially in professional practice and  life very little of your learning is  gonna be happening in a formal written  and like read and write method and so if  you're not capable of holding and  conceptually working through information  in your head comfortably an X speed you  are gonna extract a lot less learning  from experiences so this becomes an  incredibly foundational skill for all  learning later in life with immediate  tangible benefit because that means that  not only because you've thought about it  already not only is what you're writing  down simpler it also now reflects your  understanding a little bit better it  might be slightly out of order how you  did it so it's kind of like when you  write your notes and then people will go  over it again and then paraphrase it and  summarize it's like just skip that  little bit just go straight to the  paraphrasing and summarizing and then  eventually we push it back more and more  and more so that's that's the next step  and then the step after that is get rid  of lined paper so try to now Express  information in not just one dimension  but in two dimensions so while you're  thinking you want to think okay this  concept is here and that relates to it's  not no longer a line like that it's like  this concept relates to this and in  these two related  and that that causes this and in this to  occur and then once you've got that  understanding then you can put that on  paper and then that is where a mind map  comes from yeah and then continually  just try to use less and less words  start using more and more doodling and  then over the period of maybe I don't  know six months you will become able to  not write pretty much any notes and your  level of learning a hundred percent I  can guarantee you I promise you it will  be better  I can promise over you better I've never  ever had a student ever that went  through this process and reduced him a  number of words and actually moved away  from super comprehensive note-taking who  said that they did not find a  significant improvement right so I  guarantee it's gonna work and there's a  lot of research on this and similar  topics as well so that's kind of the the  process so just to reiterate so  calibrating discomfort and reducing  words and then keep eating in your head  for longer and longer and longer and  then removing that one dimensionality  and expressing it in two dimensions seem  doable  it seems doable but I always say it like  which I also know is silly but I think  one of the big reasons I rely on notes  so much and the reason I get so scared  with seeing a page that has barely  anything on it is because I think that  I'm gonna forget a lot of things which  is why no understanding is so important  but I mean is there any advice that you  can give in terms of building actually  confidence in your learning yeah so  those are good points and very common as  well so three things to say about that  the first is that when you calibrate the  discomfort that idea of not having  anything on your page doesn't become  uncomfortable for you anymore because  you're calibrating a based on what you  know it's kind of like you know take  take take your strong hobby and anyone  listening at the moment as well just  think about a hobby and imagine a hobby  that you know really well and imagine  someone's about to teach you a new  technique or improve your technique very  few people are gonna think about getting  their notebook out to write notes about  what they're about to learn they're just  gonna into a very organic learning  mentality and just because you have no  notes it doesn't mean that you're  uncomfortable you calibrate your  learning based on how well you know it  if you don't know what you're like hmm  you know I have to practice that a bit  more off to apply it a different way you  ask them questions it's a very  inquisitive process right and at the end  of that you probably have learnt it and  you know it for years if not your entire  life after learning at once right so  that sense of not having notes that's  purely just a residual you know it's  like um it's it's like it's like the  studying equivalent of male patriarchy  it's like when society tells women that  they can't be like doctors or anything  else and then you're taught to chase  after being like a perfect housewife  it's like the studying equivalent of  that it's like you have a sense of  dissonance because like you've always  been told that this is what you're meant  to do and what you're meant to want and  then the fact that you're trying to do  something else is like oh I feels  uncomfortable you have for such a long  time train your brain to think that this  is good studying when actually it's not  it's what is getting in the way of you  you know this is a pressing you're  studying independence so that's that's  one aspect the the second part is that  you will not actually forget things as  much if you do it this way by a long  amount because the forgetting curves  which talks about how information is  forgotten over time and that's why you  have things like spaced repetition and  you have you know the idea of revising  regularly so that you don't forget  things in the first place that really  applies to things that are memorized and  just random facts and it doesn't follow  four things that you just logically have  understood so when you logically  understand that you learn at once you  very rarely neat actually revise it for  it to stay there it's kind of like  forgetting how gravity works  you know you've really never have to  revise that and you will remember it for  a very long time and the other thing is  that when you learn it that way you stop  developing mental models for similar  related knowledge and so anything you  learn in the future becomes even easier  for you to learn and that's a massive  advantage especially for science type  science topics and math and things and  the third thing is that it's better to  just learn to it really well and then  never forget it  by having timed revision that challenges  you and make sure that you have retained  that then to continually relearn it  because you'll end up spending time  studying anyway like if you would create  a system when you study at once and then  never look at it again that's gonna have  flaws in it no matter what but in  reality you're gonna be spending time  studying pretty much constantly like  there's gonna be time spent on it so  it's just a matter of swapping out the  time from learning at shittily and then  relearning it again and again and again  to learning it properly and then just  keeping on top of it again and again and  again so there's really no difference  there it's just making it much more  efficient and and the amount of time you  have to spend on revising it becomes  much less because you never forgot it in  the first place you know only takes one  to two minutes to challenge yourself on  the topic that you know really well and  realize you still know it compared to  two hours on studying something that you  already spent two hours studying before  that you've forgotten completely now any  other barriers in your mind I'll read  through some of the comments actually  now if you while you think of some so  there's a few things does what you've  written so Natasha says does what you've  written then become a trigger cue to  what you've learned yes actually that is  what it should be so that is beneficial  to have notes that a more minimalistic  because even if you look at something  and you stare at it and you're like oh  my god I can't even remember what this  was talking about anymore that's  actually good because that's a  opportunity for recall or restarting and  focusing in your revision so by  highlighting the areas that a weaker  having minimal notes that actually makes  your a revision more efficient as well  so if I had to choose between heavy  notes that are so minimal that I'm  pretty sure I'm gonna forget something  on there versus notes that are slightly  more comprehensive in which I'm  definitely  I won't I will ten out of ten every time  pick the previous one because I know  that I'm future revision sessions I'm  gonna be going over it again anyway and  it's a good opportunity for me to know  what I'm forgetting should my Maps  replace notes I say pretty much yeah I  mean there's not really many things that  I give like a very umbrella general yes  to but pretty much yes so a lot of  people will say I've tried my maps and  it doesn't work but again it's one of  those situations where it's like no you  haven't tried mine much the right way so  essentially a trainee says so  essentially understand concepts before  you put them down as notes yes so keep  it in your head first this is something  that I talked about quick collision  theory which is taken from the chemistry  concept where molecules will be bouncing  around and then when they bounce with  sufficient force they collide and form a  reaction that's the same thing you want  ideas and thoughts to be bouncing in  your head enough and crossing between  hemispheres and between different areas  of your brain being expressed in  different ways so that you form a  meaningful collision and find ways that  the concepts interact to form the  reaction and the reaction is known  understanding that you can use and apply  misaki says I changed my degree of  notetaking in my current degree because  now I don't have time but I still feel  lost as to what I should be doing to  learn so basically what I've just been  saying with useless flashcards be just  as bad as useless notes spending hours  to create flashcards that you run out of  time to use so good question is the  flashcards shouldn't really be useless  to begin with if you're making them  right and doing them right so useless  fash cuts-only useless if you don't use  them so it's kind of like the flash it's  not the flashcards that are useless it's  the implementation of them when you do  it this way you have stuff that you  learn very logically and then you have a  small percentage of things that you  can't learn logically those rote  learning things that you just need to  memorize that you can't put on a mind  map that falls into flashcard territory  and then you need to do those when  they're due the problem is that most  people put everything onto flashcards  and that's not sustainable because then  you have thousands of flashcards and you  never have time to do them whereas if  you do it this way you only end up  having 10 to 15 flashcards  lecture for example because you realize  that there is very few things that you  need to actually learn at a high school  level I almost think flashcards and not  necessary because there are so little  information that you need to learn so by  the way you know that standard I was  talking about before that it worked for  you in the past well probably half of my  students that I've been coaching for a  number of months they can finish the  entire year thirteen high school  curriculum a matter of two or three  weeks of self-study and they'll probably  get all excellence at the end of that  and most students that I work was can  reach that level where they can study an  entire year thirteen curriculum and  three weeks or so so normally I say I  usually give them about one or two days  per topic to study so that I mean that's  kind of wait it's very possible like  it's very doable to reach that level I  really think most people are able to  reach that academic ability the thing is  that the current academic system is kind  of created for people that don't know  how to study and so the standard is set  really low like the bar is hella low for  academic standards so if you just know  how to study better than 99% of people  which takes 4% better technique you  instantaneously pretty much surpass or  academic challenge you know in the  formal curriculum Johanna asked how to  know which points are important to write  in the notes so good question again so  there's four different lay layers that I  separated into and this this is a topic  that I'm gonna be going over in a lot  more detail in the course but the first  layer is logical understanding the  second is concepts that are associated  with that logical understanding and then  the second part are important details  that are specific but anchor in those  concepts that you learn it bitter and in  the final layer is just specific details  that aren't really very important so you  divide it in that way so you focus on  logic first you identify which concepts  are associated with this logic you  rearrange it that way you focus in on  understanding those concepts you anchor  them in with important details and  specifics and then you just sprinkle the  remaining specific details on top check  them in flashcards and memorize that  any questions that you guys had this is  a problem that I sometimes have which is  use it just read and then after reading  like write it down is when I read I like  don't really read I just I don't know  that passively read that's actually I  can't concentrate yeah I don't know that  that's actually the term it's called  passive reading what you're doing so  there's two different types of reading  this passive reading and this act of  reading passive reading is just as  useless as passive note-taking so when  you're reading you always want to be  active reading always always always want  to be active reading so when before you  even read a paragraph in your head think  why am i reading this and what am I  trying to get out of it so there is a  question that's being answered so it has  meaning so think about this like just  think about how weird it is that you're  putting yourself artificially in a  position where you are just consuming  information that you feel no relevance  to for no real reason other than to sit  a test compared to how our brain has  evolved to actually work which is a very  intuitive problem-solving machine it has  a problem it clicks information and  consumes information in order to solve a  problem and to you know fill a gap and  knowledge so before you've read you need  to identify the gap what's the gap  you're trying to fill and then look for  information to fill it once it's filled  don't go on to continue passively  reading think okay where now what's my  next gap where am I going with this  what do I want to know from the  information and then again you start  reading and sometimes that means that  you're reading out of order but actually  that's better  so active reading is a very engaging  process it's like if you like if you  just discovered that your parents are  like not your parents and then you've  just uncovered like a news clip clipping  from like 40 years ago and you're trying  to like figure out who your real parents  are you're gonna be hunting through  every single detail and you know every  day and every name is gonna have a  different meaning because you  so driven and inquisitive to filling  that problem that that very detective II  kind of mentality as what you should be  thinking while you study some my  students that struggle to do that I  actually say as soon as you feel like  you're entering the passive reading stop  get up walk around until you have a gap  or a problem and then only when you have  the gap do you sit back down and start  reading because otherwise it trains your  brain to be okay with passive reading  and that's not a good you know condition  conditioning situation that you want to  be in yeah that's very different to  helping you read yeah so all of it  should be quite more a bit more active  not Nicole just asked how do you know  what details you missed out when you  write minimal notes you know what  details you missed out because it  doesn't make sense in your head first so  if it makes sense in your head first you  put it down and if that makes sense and  it's all good and you cushion it and you  challenge it and you're still being very  curious then and and all of that seems  to be pretty well represented then  that's fine you've got it the remaining  stuff that in your course guide or  lecture material or whatever you're  studying that isn't on there you then  find a way to make sense of it by  connecting it by sweeping through and  seeing what you missed or if it still  doesn't make sense you check those are  flashcards so you should never really  miss anything  realistically because you'll always comb  through it again and remember studying  happens in multiple iterations so if you  missed it on the first time you're gonna  pick it up the next week when you do  your weekly revision with mind maps so  Celine says with mind maps would you say  the same for layers apply to what info  you should include on it how would you  structure a good mind map so I've got a  YouTube video about mind maps and it's a  bit of a long topic so I'm not gonna go  into that in a lot of dips at the moment  but I would just say make sure to  represent the mental understanding not  not relying on the notes so you're not  writing the notes for the sake of the  notes you're just representing how it  looks like in your head first if your  mind map is messy it means it's not  clean in your head have it super clean  very organized  very clear very simplified in your head  so you're like I got it I understand it  and I just want to document my thinking  that's the mind man  does it still apply for more  mathematical subjects yes it does  maths is a really different it's  actually the same process but you have  to just apply it on a deeper level so  you start applying these why why do why  do these things happen like conceptual  layer level of thinking to the equations  and the theorems behind maths and then  the details become examples in cases  that you apply afterwards any other  questions send them through what will  party be on this for another live stream  for another ten ten fifteen fifteen  minutes at most so if you guys have any  other questions as well  [Music]  what about um sort of like tips to  overcome perfectionism because even if I  had my like a mind map or something I  always have a tendency to try and make  it look perfect or like pretty yeah so I  know that it wastes time because I'm  noise I don't like this I'll just like  start it again or something yeah so I'm  a friction Asst I'm a perfectionist and  I hold myself to a very high standard  that my standards are so high that I  pretty much just assume that I'll really  never ever reach them you know and  anyone that really knows when a personal  level will know that there are times I  can get very involved in something to  just perfect it like when I'm working on  a website like I will spend hours to get  a pixel perfect when no one else will  notice except for me and like I  legitimately a few days ago spent three  hours figuring out how to make a corner  look rounded instead of square and no  one else would have cared but where are  you directing that perfectionism so  perfectionism is formed from an  insecurity why do you insecure about I'm  insecure about spending a hundred hours  studying to get 10 hours of knowledge  I'm insecure about the fact that I can't  be perfect in other areas of my life  that I want to be I'm insecure  about the fact that I don't want to be  riding out 40 pages of notes and then  get to the time I said a test and just  not know anything or that I'm reading  and then I'm using my brain at a 3.5  percent capacity that's what I am  insecure about and so my notes are quite  neat actually and they look pretty good  because I spend time to like make it  pretty but it's still minimalistic and  it's that when I look at it I'm just  like this is a perfect representation of  my mind and that satisfies me and I  think there is so little clutter this is  clean this knowledge does not give me  joy I've been that and I look at my mind  map at end of it I just think like this  is like this is good learning like this  was a really good study session I was  very focused my notes are clean I was  spending my time well that elements I do  have a very clear and easy to understand  my arrows are distinct and clear and  dynamic my points are well aligned the  logical flow is perfect and can't be  simplified any more so when I look at  other people's notes and they're super  comprehensive and they're really linear  and long I guess so dissatisfied looking  at that it's like it's like if you're a  master painter and then you just see  someone just throwing paint at a wall  and then they're like every aspect is  covered and it's just like dripping and  disgusting and it's just like can slow  clap for you right so just direct that  perfectionism to something that actually  matters because you're not perfectionist  about everything right when you brush  your teeth do you get like a convict a  concave mirror like magnify on every  single crevice to make sure that you've  removed like every molecule of plaque it  was like you know you're not you're not  a perfectionist about everything you  just put perfectionist about the things  that you care about so what I'm saying  is care less about I'm studying and care  more about I need to learn  advice on sleep sleep is another big  topic and it's probably a bit too much  to go over in this current video it's a  good question but um the only the  biggest piece of advice I would say is  have good sleep hygiene look that up  have a good sleep routine and make sure  that you never compromise on sleep  because especially if you're studying  you want to have good sleep because of a  phenomenon called  sleep dependent memory consolidation  which is the time when learned  information is consolidated from parts  of your brain that store information  more short-term and then put it into the  higher-level cortices where you can then  apply and use it and understand it at a  higher level so without sleep that  process is incredibly slow and and  sometimes just straight up doesn't  happen Joanna just says should we read  through all points only then we write  our notes or write at one buy run one by  one depends on how much discomfort you  can handle I try to just do as much as  possible before I write down anything  but that calming light disappeared on my  screen I don't know what happened but  anyway but if you if you can tolerate  taking a little bit more discomfort read  a bit more those are a bit more points  before you put it down let's say that  you were to go to a lecture now how  would you take notes  what would you just I don't know  annotate the slide make any sense  because the slides don't reflect your  understanding the slides are not how you  know it in your head the slides aren't  how you understand it when you think of  the topic you don't think of the slides  and a three page you know three slide  page and annotation doesn't reflect how  the concepts interact there's no  connection it hasn't been made since you  can't simplify it so annotating slides  becomes like everyone one of the most  passive ways of studying so I wouldn't  do that at all  I would before the lecture prime my  knowledge so I have a basic idea of the  overall framework and then I'll take my  basic mind map with a basic skeletal  framework into the lecture  and test that logic and start adding on  to it concepts and important details and  I would try to connect it and simplify  it  they speak I hold on to it I hold on to  it I hold on to it I try to connect I  simplify I'm constantly in my head  applying and simplifying and getting it  convincing it's an analogy I give us  like when you're playing like bejeweled  or like candy crush or something and you  line everything up and it just gets like  you know like it just compresses down  you know  well like it becomes like a really  shining like electrified one and you  like click that and then it just like  deletes the whole column in row like  that's what I try to do in my head with  a knowledge how can I make this piece of  information line up with other pieces of  information in such a way that it really  just becomes one thing rather than four  things and how can I make it so that  this one thing is really pretty much  just an extension of something I already  knew and that's what I'm constantly  doing in my head and that simplified  understanding at some point I feel like  I can't hold on to it anymore  I put it on my mindmap so it's the same  process in my head as when I'm reading  information and that makes sense because  it's simply two different modes of  consuming information  I either consume information through my  eyes or I consume information through my  eyes and ears but what goes in onto my  head is organizing reorganizing and  constructing that information so there's  there's not really much difference and  that's why at the end of it I don't know  any of the specific details I've missed  half the important details but I've got  a really good understanding of the logic  and the concepts and some of the  important details and so I just need to  spend an additional hour mopping up the  rest so then in that case though like I  mean I don't know if it's like this for  you mister but the reason I actually  annotate my notes is because I'm scared  I'm gonna miss something that the  lecturer yes if it's not on the slide so  when you when you do you prime before  the lecture I have started in the last  two weeks well yeah so priming takes  away a lot of that because you know  what's available and the other resources  even just recognizing like oh yeah  they're talking about this and I know  that then the textbook somewhere like  that cuts away a lot of that already if  there are specific things that the  lecturer says that you think might not  be anywhere else on any other resource  while you study then yes you can write  that down but usually that's very  minimal like the  be licious with they might not say  anything that fits that criteria most  people will get a little bit too  overboard with that so you know just  have a focus on that so you can write  those sorts of things down but it's it  usually doesn't end up being much at all  Natasha Tye asks how do you learning  styles visual auditory kinesthetic  affect our note-taking or reading it  doesn't learning styles is a myth  there's no such thing as learning styles  there's lots of studies done on this go  look it up on wire learning styles is a  myth there was a company a long time ago  called vaak which stood for visual  auditory reading right kinesthetic who  made royalties off of selling a quiz  that tests you on your learning style  and gives you a learning style and it  was really popular back in the day but  now they just a struggling company  trying to remain relevant so that's  pretty much just learning pseudoscience  so there's no such thing as really  learning styles the best way to learn is  to learn use all learning styles so like  multimodal learning is the best way to  learn all the time always for everything  because it uses more of your brain it  just forces it into more different  cortices so everything you learn learn  it at all the different ways and when  you revise it mix those up and that's  how you can create lots of different  variations of revision just by changing  those variables around so if you think  I'm a visual learner I'm a dis learner  you're wrong when you talk about  reviewing your notes in the following  week how would you schedule what to  review each week and when you review is  it like reading them I met without  looking yeah so whenever you review just  used recall or reconstruction techniques  so there's a lot of people know about  recognition versus recall recognition is  saying what is this it's a cup recall  would be like saying draw that cup how  well can you draw it recall is obviously  much harder recognition is virtually  useless so it doesn't really have any  place in revision so try to do only  recall based learning or if possible  take it to the next level which is  reconstruction reconstruction is saying  that you have multiple components to the  learning and then you not only can  recall each component but you're able to  reconstruct it in such a way that you  even are changing the order of things  around and  in a way that makes sense so you are  actively taking knowledge and applying  it in different ways and abstracting on  the information different to how you  learned it originally and that's even at  an even higher level so all revision  just try to do it that way  what do you revise each week you just  revise whatever you you learnt that  previous week so just try to make a  schedule while you're revising it on the  day a couple days later one week later a  month later and then two months later  how's apply when learning languages  learning languages a little bit  different language learning is a skill  and skill learning means take the  shortest possible path towards applying  the skill as possible and just do a  constant learning loop so learn just  enough to apply the skill as quickly as  possible  apply the skill and then reflect on what  you need to improve on and then just  consistently do that loop spend as  little time learning as you can and as  much time getting to getting to the  application as possible how to arrange  our time for revision when we have too  much homework and outside tuition well  number one get rid of outside tuition  because it's a waste of money time  resources it takes away your ability to  think by yourself and if you or your  parents don't like it you either say  screw you yourself or screw you your  parents and then cancel it don't show up  to tuition or begrudgingly go and try  not to listen to them or if you need to  do it anyway just milk them for  information but don't rely on it if  you're spending time getting tuition to  be spoon-fed something you're literally  paying someone to teach you something  that you could learn yourself because  you can't learn it yourself I would be  more concerned about the fact that you  can't learn it yourself how do you  arrange time for revision if you've got  too much other stuff use micro learning  techniques and I've got a video called  bursts studying use that because we're  studying is designed so that you can  study in short intervals and get a lot  of work done in a short period of time  final questions how do you transition  from one-dimensional learning to writing  listen utilizing two dimensional  learning so that's talking about doing  mind maps you transition from one  dimensional and it's a top fan so I'm  gonna be a top answer one dimensional  learning to two dimensional learning you  have to most of that process happens  your mind is that when you're actually  learning you have to really actively be  trying to spatially arranged concepts in  your head and make room and see how it  flows together and so when you start  doing this type of note-taking you will  naturally because you know it needs to  be out put it that way anyway you'll  start thinking in that sort of style and  that will really help clear things up  because often when we learn we kind of  have a vague understanding of it but  it's hard to be specific and explicit  enough about where it sits in our  knowledge to be very clear about like  where we want to put it this will force  us to put it somewhere and really refine  those connections with mind maps is it  good to make a big mind map combining  key topics yes or is it good to make  smaller mind maps about it no yeah so  the bigger the better especially when  you're learning at a lower level so like  when you're learning really easy basic  stuff like like high school material  then there's so little concepts in a  single class or a single block that once  you do it this way you'll realize that  this entire class is talking about one  quarter of one concept and it's like  impossible to actually portray that so  you have to do an entire topic all at  once where you have four or five  concepts and six or seven important  details other questions you guys I think  it's just doing it now yeah yeah the  methods to go in between from where  you're comfortable to where you want to  be and it's just a matter of actually  doing it yeah and it's very doable if  you take it in small steps right yeah it  appears that way yeah so just just just  do whatever you feel is gonna be  sustainable like you know the steps that  I outline when I say reduce the amount  of words that you use you know it's up  to your discretion about how much  discomfort you're gonna tolerate to make  it sustainable you might only be  reducing your words by like one word per  sentence and that's dual progress and  then you might reduce it by two where  you know so on and so forth so just you  know Confucius it'll someone said if you  fall on your face you're still moving  forward so you know just focus  any amount of marginal gain give you a  little bit of time to think of questions  any other questions on Facebook leave  them in the comments this is a last call  any questions that don't come through in  the next minute you have to wait till  the next study clinic or comb through  all the other videos that we have well  maybe a question that the audience might  like is how often do normally do these  study clinics things yeah I've actually  been asked that a lot  I've actually asked that every single  day I don't know it's it's really  infrequent I at the moment what's this  whole Facebook page and my channels and  Instagram and things I pretty much just  do things whenever I feel like people  will tune in so like if I did a study  clinic tomorrow I just feel like not  many people would watch so I wouldn't do  one and then after a certain amount of  time I feel like oh yeah people will  probably watch if I do another one and  that's kind of when I do it I'm probably  gonna get into doing a study clinic once  every fortnight or once a month and then  a DM C once a month because I also have  private study clinics I do like  one-on-one with people and I do one of  those usually like once a week or so it  just depends on the load because these  days I get about 12 or 15 messages a day  from people wanting specific study  advice and it feels mean to like leave  them hanging for like a month to do  another study clinic which is why I do  them this frequently but um yeah just  keep an eye out in the future and also  the more people that are joining in and  the more people that are contributing  the more incentivize I'll be to do more  of them and so that means you know  everyone should be tagging and inviting  all of their friends hey if you've got  like 500 friends on Facebook and you  click invite all friends and there's  like 40-something people watching at the  moment so that's a lot of potential new  followers to really incentivize me  otherwise I may never do one of these  again that's right I mean I did share  this is my Facebook and I think a few of  my friends are watching I think so  because people are saying hi Joanna says  and this is probably the final quiz  and Joanna says which environment is  suitable for studying again it's a big  topic the environment doesn't matter so  much as the factors in the environment  which you usually can modify and control  so experiment and think about what are  the things in your environment that you  need in order to maintain focus and then  implement those within your focus zone  and you will notice that there are  certain trends and also that this will  change as you get older or more  experienced and you will realize that  you can study in some weird situations  because you can modify a few of those  factors like you can study on the bus  you can study in various different  places and another thing is leverage  technology in order to enable you to do  this so simple things like for example  wearing headphones and earphones and  playing white noise and things like that  but for example if you get motion sick  like I do on the bus or in the car doing  flashcards or whatever install like a  motion a motion sickness app on your  phone which creates an artificial  horizon for you to look at and that gets  rid of motion sickness so there's  actually a lot of ways that you can look  for where a situation where technology  is so advanced in this way that if you  just look for something to solve a  problem there might be something there  and they can do that  Vishakha says any thoughts on studying  when tired yes many thoughts about that  don't I think it's basically with the  whole sorry cuz you're just like  everything is all about active learning  and stuff because that is obviously the  best way to learn but like being tired  really challenges yeah three different  types of tired  there's the tutor two to five pm tired  where you just like will fall asleep no  matter what you're doing and in that  case you're gonna realize the  alternative to being like you know you  can if you're gonna fall asleep that's  zero percent productivity so doing  something that's even 1% productive is  an improvement so in so a lot of people  will try to just modify their current  studying to be more engaging so they  don't fall asleep don't do that find the  thing that's definitely gonna keep you  awake and modify that to be more  productive so even if you're only  getting at  like if you're not gonna fall asleep by  going for a jog go for a jog and then  maybe listen to a podcast or just go  through a mental mind map in your head  and even if you only get 1% learning out  of that it was actually better than the  alternative which was nothing so that's  one type of tired the other type of  tired is like I've been studying for a  long-ass time type of tired and in that  situation I recommend watching my video  about work wrist breaks and how to take  effective breaks because I cover that  topic in more depth and I've got another  video coming up either tomorrow or in a  couple days about that specific topic as  well about how to take effective breaks  and I've really recommend I'm watching  that  if you're a parent and you're always  tired well actually you know a lot of my  clients and a lot of people I'm students  that I work with are parents and  actually a lot of them are a single  parents as well there's always a way if  you use active techniques like micro  learning if you and that's another  reason why being able to learn in your  head without needing to write notes are  so effective because you can do it  pretty much any way like you can be in  the shower and be studying more  effectively than someone that's in the  library right fully legitimately so  we're past in how I now if you've got  any other questions you have to save it  up for the next study clinic any final  questions or anything that you wanted to  say thank you yeah just thanks oh great  I'm glad you found it useful thanks for  coming in and joining on this this will  be available as a recording and I'll  also be cutting up snippets of it of  some of the highlighted most important  parts and chucking them on Facebook and  Instagram over the next month or so just  for people that missed it so yeah thanks  everyone for tuning in and see you on  the next DMC your clinic thanks guys  thank you thanks yeah

this is disturbing do you do you watch  the have you listened to the podcast at  all Nesta yeah I listened to the first  one about the girl with the Food Channel  oh yeah yeah okay even you skipped all  that well you haven't seen any of the  episodes where Justin has a cold and we  like they're like film it three episodes  at the same time so here's like a cold  for three episodes especially when you  know what Justin is actually actually  supposed to sound like it's so like  frustrating to listen to your nose but  oh okay we're live now can you see it  [Laughter]  now I said can you see the comments my  friend just sent me a picture of her  watching it so - Shaka  I can hear hi hello yeah do they not  have this sound turned on their phone  maybe not  mm Hugh Justin maybe uh my friend said  that they can hear me and Emma but not  Justin I don't have any advice to give  so that's not that helpful  okay can we hear me now I will take a  while for it to update but hopefully  okay let me know if you can hear me I  think now you should be able to  hopefully I think they can hear you now  okay great cool good all right so let me  do that intro again so we're talking  about note-taking and we're talking  about why it's better to write list  notes why writing lots of notes is not  good for you it reduces not only  efficiency but also your quality of  learning and why most people will write  lots and lots and lots of notes and that  is incredibly detrimental to the  learning process and how and why we  should write as the title says ten times  list notes no matter what you're  studying really this this account this  is if you are in high school doing you  know high school subjects if you are in  pre-med at doing biology science if you  are studying law accounting economics  finance whatever you're studying even if  you're learning a skill if you think you  want to write notes you should be  writing a lot less and these are the  reasons why so the reason that we write  notes in the first place is so that we  can learn something right that's the  basic principle but actually  we are so used to writing notes that we  are no longer writing notes in order to  learn we end up writing notes in order  to study but studying doesn't always  equal learning and so if you're  highlighting a page and you're  highlighting and you're highlighting and  then the question is like why why are  you bothering to highlight well because  it's just what you always do or helps  you like go back to it at a later time  and it's like okay so why are you doing  something to help you go back to at a  later time instead of just doing  something that's gonna help you learn it  to begin with right so what we want to  do is take the direct shortest line to  meaningful learning as quickly as  possible because if you know it in your  head you don't need to even write the  notes the purpose is to know it not to  write the notes and so the danger is  that when you write lots and lots of  notes you have this illusion of learning  you think you're learning when actually  you haven't learned anything which is  why most people when they finish writing  their notes they probably only know 10  to 20 percent of the stuff that they  wrote so it's like okay congratulations  you spent like four hours writing these  notes and three and a half of those  hours were completely useless in the  learning process all the learning is  gonna happen later now some people will  say well the act of reading and writing  it actually helps me learn know the act  of reading and writing doesn't help you  learn we know that because if you just  turn your brain off and copy/paste  something like if you're just copying  out a line again and again you can do  that without thinking at all it's just a  motor movement all you have to do is  read it recognize and then send it  straight out again and it it doesn't  actually have to go through any part of  your brain that is processing it in a  meaningful way so the learning happens  when you actually think about it and  when it goes to other areas of the brain  so think about that when you're reading  and writing the learning you do feel  that occurs is actually occurring by  accident it only occurs because that  thought happens to escape the pathway  that you have set for it and go out  somewhere and associate with other areas  maybe cross hemispheres  and it's processed in a secondary way  and then it is expressed back up in the  writing so all I'm saying is spend less  time making it going from reading to  writing and spend more time going from  reading to thinking and connecting and  processing and then stay there do that  for longer and then once you've  understood it then write it and what  you'll end up writing naturally will be  much less that what you needed to write  at the beginning right so I'm just  saying learn first and then write rather  than read write read write read write  accidentally learn and then go over it  again you know dozens of times in order  to just smash it into your brain through  repetition right so so we're pretty  clear on that and by the way for anyone  that's watching obviously as usual if  you have questions leave them in the  comments leave them quickly because  there's a minute delay between when you  leave the comment versus when I see it  I'm sorry  between me saying something and the  common actually coming up so that's the  basic theory from you guys perspectives  what are the sort of challenges or  issues that you feel was trying to apply  that in in real life for me personally  and I know I don't know if it's the same  for Nesta I think it's that I know deep  down that writing notes is probably not  the most efficient way but in the first  place it has always worked for me so  it's kind of more challenging to trick  myself or like to get myself to do and  I'll do it another way  plus it's more so I think a confidence  problem because I don't I feel like if I  haven't put hours of work in or if I  don't have something right in front of  me to refer to that like I haven't  really done anything or that I'm not  gonna be able to learn or remember it or  even recall it I'm not sure what it is  for Nestor but that's kind of what it is  for me yeah I don't know I think I've  just met in the past just written a lot  of notes and so that's what I feel  comfortable with but I do kind of know  that deep down it's not that effective  but it's just what I feel most come  a birth but I know that learning should  sometimes make you feel uncomfortable  otherwise you're not learning yeah  actually it's it's more than just that  it's actually learning should pretty  much always make you feel pretty  uncomfortable at this Comfort is  actually the learning so if you're  learning something and it feels really  comfortable then you're probably not  actually using your brain in a very  active way that's actually that you know  that confusion in that chaos that comes  with having something that you don't  understand and trying to frantically  figure it out that is actually vital  like you should be seeking that at every  opportunity so you guys I kind of talked  about the same thing I've always done it  that worked before and therefore it's  comfortable and I don't want to change  even though deep down I kind of know so  let's break that down into the it's  worked before it's comfortable and the  deep down pot so it's worked before so  in what situation hasn't worked before  so let me ask you like are you able to  study for like are you able to study a  lecture like a one-hour lecture in one  hour and get a plus from it no I don't  think so  working very well for you is it then  well compared to what I've always been  doing it's the same so it's like yeah I  spent three hours that this is what I  expect for myself and then I can do well  with it which I know is inefficient but  I still continue to do it anyway yeah so  when are you actually doing getting the  learning done so after you finish  writing everything how much of that do  you actually know probably a lot I think  even when I describe it to friends I  always say like just because I've  written notes doesn't mean I know it  like I say that regularly so I kind of  know that writing yeah I feel like  writing notes is like you're making  something to study off if that makes  yeah when there's actually in front of  you yeah you're not learning it you're  just like making something so it's  easier for future you to study yeah  which doesn't make  a lot of sense because you're creating a  system that you know is wasting time so  in the time it takes you to write your  notes and not have learnt it I will have  already learnt it and then double the  amount and then so later when you go to  learn it I will still know it and you  will now be learning it so it's just  there's there's no difference it's like  would you rather learn it now would you  rather learn it later  except waste a lot of time now it's like  saying like okay you've got $100 to  spend would you rather spend $100 and  then get $200 back or would you rather  spend $100 and then get nothing back and  then it's been another hundred dollars  and then get $100 back it's like one of  them just doesn't make any sense to do  the other one is like a no-brainer  decision so if if you're writing and  you're like imagine that you are like  imagine any other skill right think of  your hobby and imagine a particular  technique was in that hobby okay and  let's say that you you can pull it off  10 to 20 percent of the time would you  say that you that that's working well  for you you're probably a beginner can  flips into 20 yeah so if you're reading  and writing nodes and by the end of that  writing process you've only learned 10  to 20 percent of it and honestly for  some people 20 percent is a stretch and  that's what you end up with at the very  end that's that's not called working  that means that your standards have  dropped so low that you just don't even  realize that it's not working  it's like communism like you have so  little that you think you've got  everything but you just don't know that  you could have a lot more so think about  this imagine that you you have a lecture  and that lecture is one hour okay you  spend 10 minutes before the lecture and  then after the lecture at the as soon as  the lecture ends you have a 50%  understanding of the topic  okay and then you spend an additional  hour studying the lecture and by then if  you said it if he's had a test you'd get  an A to A plus okay but the thing is  it's never gonna happen with the you  know current sort of way that you're  doing things and the reason is because  of the second point which is that's  comfortable so number one you think it  works but it doesn't work what you think  is that it not it's not different to  before the difference is that it never  worked it might have worked back in high  school when it's so easy that you can  just do whatever the hell you want you  can just not study at all and that will  still work for you but it doesn't work  when things are actually legitimately  challenging so it doesn't work or it  works by shoveling a lot of time into it  and then you get this crappy little  smidgen of a result out but it's  comfortable comfort means it's automatic  cuff amines it's something that you're  very used to so you're probably not  gonna be able to get any more efficient  using that system no matter how hard you  try your current system without changing  it in a big way is probably you already  reached the limit of that current way of  studying so that kind of yeah I'd love  for that to happen that there will be  just a dream if you don't actually make  the changes necessary to do it so  there's there's no possible option so  you either make the decision of I'd  rather be more efficient at studying  what rather just be comfortable yeah I  think that's also another part of the  issue which is just like it seems like  it's gonna take like I know that my  current note-taking takes a lot of time  but it also seems like learning a new  way to study is going to take a lot of  time as well and at the end of it I'm  not gonna know if it's worked or not so  I'm just like why don't I just stick  with this even though that's a very  short-sighted way of thinking it is a  very sad way but think about it this way  it's like you could spend time to learn  something now and struggle and then  eventually get good at a  and then succeed or you could spend time  struggling now and then never get any  result and then just forever struggle  until your standards get so low that you  just don't care anymore and then you  give up what you want to do it like I  mean you're gonna make that decision  that's a tough one I like I know what  the right decision is but that's with  the discomfort and like the fear comes  in and like the lack of confidence I'm  able to make that change which is what  my like the biggest issue is because I  think most students know deep down like  note-taking isn't useful like you don't  feel like you've learned anything after  you feel like you've got a resource to  study from but you haven't actually  learnt anything but it's just like that  process of shifting is a bit it feels  unsafe like you I'm just upgrading my  stripe account because I just realized  that it's on a limit so give me one  second for me to just do that real quick  all kind of few people commented I'm and  I will look at the comments in a second  as why and I will I will address what  you've just said about that confidence  and everything as well  hey Katie  sorry about the delay  okay great so and the stream will have  just shut down but don't worry about  that it's gonna come back real soon  I mean it still seems like it's life to  me that's just the on their nose oh I've  grade my accounts so just fixing that  yeah I was like I'm pouring my heart out  to you Justin oh look at this look at  the camera what are you what are you  doing okay  okay okay so read that okay we're back  so you're talking about confidence and  not having the confidence to do it so  are we on the sort of same page that we  do need to change it and it's worth  changing and that even if it's difficult  it's part you know it is something that  actually will be worthwhile to change  yeah but we just it's like the intention  get right actually and then like how  should we change I guess yeah so both  become the sort of same thing so you can  you can push the boundary in a safe can  you know there's two ways that you go  about it you either make big changes  with high risk or you make small changes  with low risk depending on your  personality type so if you're happy to  just screw it and just you know flip  everything and then take a big risk  changing it in a big way and this is  what I'll do with coaching because we  can just supervise but if you especially  if you're doing it solo the risk is  probably so high doing it that way  you're probably gonna do it so wrong  that you will just end up reverting back  to what you were doing before which is  why often people will say like oh I  tried this technique and it didn't work  for me and it's like no you did the  technique wrong which is why I didn't  work for you  if you did a writer would work so  there's a few different steps that I  would outline the first is just take  your notes and just just try to reduce  the number of words that's just the  first step simply try to reduce the  number of words just get into the habit  of not needing to write out full words  or full sentences and just break that  idea of kind of like  perfect sentences and perfect paragraphs  and get more in tune with the idea of  perfect learning so be less focused on  how much of my variety how many hours am  i spending be more in tune with the idea  of how much learning is occurring right  now  and that needs to become very  uncomfortable when you're studying and  you're realizing that your efficiency of  learning is really low that you've been  writing for the last hour and you've  learnt almost nothing that needs to  become very dissatisfying and  uncomfortable and cause you anxiety  because that's gonna push you to  continually change to be more efficient  so if you're obsessed with oh my god  look how beautiful this says hashtag  study Graham and then that's what your  idea of like good learning is and then  you set the test and you're getting like  class average by doing 10 times the  amount that everyone else has been  studying then that needs to be the  objective reality it's like I am right  now funneling time into the abyss and  not I'm not gonna get any of it back I'm  never gonna get this time back right  well think about all those hobbies that  you would want to do or that you have to  give up or like people that you could  spend time with so socialize and all the  things that you're sacrificing because  you suck at studying and that needs to  make you uncomfortable so work on that  first building discomfort by calibrating  to things that actually matter not with  arbitrary hours or number of nodes but  what's real learning and then start  reducing the amount of notes the second  step is delay the note-taking process if  normally you'd read a few sentences and  write notes read a paragraph and write  notes read two paragraphs and write  notes and just continue to push that out  until you don't feel the need to write  notes as much and you're more  comfortable thinking about things in  your head and you're more comfortable  with just kind of a sort of conflict  resolution conceptually thinking about  things figuring out how things make  sense and how they fit into place how  that works inside your head first and  then express your new understanding on  your notes alright so that's the second  step so the first step is simply  calibrating discomfort and then just  getting used to reducing words using  shorthand and symbols and things like  that and then the next step is just  delaying the onset of note-taking to a  little bit after you have thought about  it and just can continually think about  a little bit more and a bit more and a  bit more in a bit more and you want to  calibrate that to your sense of  discomfort so normally you might read  and you might be uncomfortable with not  writing notes at a certain point just  tell yourself okay I'm just gonna read a  little bit more and then I'll write my  notes and then stay at that level and  then push it a little bit I'm gonna read  a little bit more and just continually  push that it will be slow but  sustainable progress and eventually you  should be able to read pretty much an  entire lick show without needing to  write notes and then you'll think about  it you'll learn most of the content in  your head and in your right and now this  is incredibly important because later on  especially in professional practice and  life very little of your learning is  gonna be happening in a formal written  and like read and write method and so if  you're not capable of holding and  conceptually working through information  in your head comfortably an X speed you  are gonna extract a lot less learning  from experiences so this becomes an  incredibly foundational skill for all  learning later in life with immediate  tangible benefit because that means that  not only because you've thought about it  already not only is what you're writing  down simpler it also now reflects your  understanding a little bit better it  might be slightly out of order how you  did it so it's kind of like when you  write your notes and then people will go  over it again and then paraphrase it and  summarize it's like just skip that  little bit just go straight to the  paraphrasing and summarizing and then  eventually we push it back more and more  and more so that's that's the next step  and then the step after that is get rid  of lined paper so try to now Express  information in not just one dimension  but in two dimensions so while you're  thinking you want to think okay this  concept is here and that relates to it's  not no longer a line like that it's like  this concept relates to this and in  these two related  and that that causes this and in this to  occur and then once you've got that  understanding then you can put that on  paper and then that is where a mind map  comes from yeah and then continually  just try to use less and less words  start using more and more doodling and  then over the period of maybe I don't  know six months you will become able to  not write pretty much any notes and your  level of learning a hundred percent I  can guarantee you I promise you it will  be better  I can promise over you better I've never  ever had a student ever that went  through this process and reduced him a  number of words and actually moved away  from super comprehensive note-taking who  said that they did not find a  significant improvement right so I  guarantee it's gonna work and there's a  lot of research on this and similar  topics as well so that's kind of the the  process so just to reiterate so  calibrating discomfort and reducing  words and then keep eating in your head  for longer and longer and longer and  then removing that one dimensionality  and expressing it in two dimensions seem  doable  it seems doable but I always say it like  which I also know is silly but I think  one of the big reasons I rely on notes  so much and the reason I get so scared  with seeing a page that has barely  anything on it is because I think that  I'm gonna forget a lot of things which  is why no understanding is so important  but I mean is there any advice that you  can give in terms of building actually  confidence in your learning yeah so  those are good points and very common as  well so three things to say about that  the first is that when you calibrate the  discomfort that idea of not having  anything on your page doesn't become  uncomfortable for you anymore because  you're calibrating a based on what you  know it's kind of like you know take  take take your strong hobby and anyone  listening at the moment as well just  think about a hobby and imagine a hobby  that you know really well and imagine  someone's about to teach you a new  technique or improve your technique very  few people are gonna think about getting  their notebook out to write notes about  what they're about to learn they're just  gonna into a very organic learning  mentality and just because you have no  notes it doesn't mean that you're  uncomfortable you calibrate your  learning based on how well you know it  if you don't know what you're like hmm  you know I have to practice that a bit  more off to apply it a different way you  ask them questions it's a very  inquisitive process right and at the end  of that you probably have learnt it and  you know it for years if not your entire  life after learning at once right so  that sense of not having notes that's  purely just a residual you know it's  like um it's it's like it's like the  studying equivalent of male patriarchy  it's like when society tells women that  they can't be like doctors or anything  else and then you're taught to chase  after being like a perfect housewife  it's like the studying equivalent of  that it's like you have a sense of  dissonance because like you've always  been told that this is what you're meant  to do and what you're meant to want and  then the fact that you're trying to do  something else is like oh I feels  uncomfortable you have for such a long  time train your brain to think that this  is good studying when actually it's not  it's what is getting in the way of you  you know this is a pressing you're  studying independence so that's that's  one aspect the the second part is that  you will not actually forget things as  much if you do it this way by a long  amount because the forgetting curves  which talks about how information is  forgotten over time and that's why you  have things like spaced repetition and  you have you know the idea of revising  regularly so that you don't forget  things in the first place that really  applies to things that are memorized and  just random facts and it doesn't follow  four things that you just logically have  understood so when you logically  understand that you learn at once you  very rarely neat actually revise it for  it to stay there it's kind of like  forgetting how gravity works  you know you've really never have to  revise that and you will remember it for  a very long time and the other thing is  that when you learn it that way you stop  developing mental models for similar  related knowledge and so anything you  learn in the future becomes even easier  for you to learn and that's a massive  advantage especially for science type  science topics and math and things and  the third thing is that it's better to  just learn to it really well and then  never forget it  by having timed revision that challenges  you and make sure that you have retained  that then to continually relearn it  because you'll end up spending time  studying anyway like if you would create  a system when you study at once and then  never look at it again that's gonna have  flaws in it no matter what but in  reality you're gonna be spending time  studying pretty much constantly like  there's gonna be time spent on it so  it's just a matter of swapping out the  time from learning at shittily and then  relearning it again and again and again  to learning it properly and then just  keeping on top of it again and again and  again so there's really no difference  there it's just making it much more  efficient and and the amount of time you  have to spend on revising it becomes  much less because you never forgot it in  the first place you know only takes one  to two minutes to challenge yourself on  the topic that you know really well and  realize you still know it compared to  two hours on studying something that you  already spent two hours studying before  that you've forgotten completely now any  other barriers in your mind I'll read  through some of the comments actually  now if you while you think of some so  there's a few things does what you've  written so Natasha says does what you've  written then become a trigger cue to  what you've learned yes actually that is  what it should be so that is beneficial  to have notes that a more minimalistic  because even if you look at something  and you stare at it and you're like oh  my god I can't even remember what this  was talking about anymore that's  actually good because that's a  opportunity for recall or restarting and  focusing in your revision so by  highlighting the areas that a weaker  having minimal notes that actually makes  your a revision more efficient as well  so if I had to choose between heavy  notes that are so minimal that I'm  pretty sure I'm gonna forget something  on there versus notes that are slightly  more comprehensive in which I'm  definitely  I won't I will ten out of ten every time  pick the previous one because I know  that I'm future revision sessions I'm  gonna be going over it again anyway and  it's a good opportunity for me to know  what I'm forgetting should my Maps  replace notes I say pretty much yeah I  mean there's not really many things that  I give like a very umbrella general yes  to but pretty much yes so a lot of  people will say I've tried my maps and  it doesn't work but again it's one of  those situations where it's like no you  haven't tried mine much the right way so  essentially a trainee says so  essentially understand concepts before  you put them down as notes yes so keep  it in your head first this is something  that I talked about quick collision  theory which is taken from the chemistry  concept where molecules will be bouncing  around and then when they bounce with  sufficient force they collide and form a  reaction that's the same thing you want  ideas and thoughts to be bouncing in  your head enough and crossing between  hemispheres and between different areas  of your brain being expressed in  different ways so that you form a  meaningful collision and find ways that  the concepts interact to form the  reaction and the reaction is known  understanding that you can use and apply  misaki says I changed my degree of  notetaking in my current degree because  now I don't have time but I still feel  lost as to what I should be doing to  learn so basically what I've just been  saying with useless flashcards be just  as bad as useless notes spending hours  to create flashcards that you run out of  time to use so good question is the  flashcards shouldn't really be useless  to begin with if you're making them  right and doing them right so useless  fash cuts-only useless if you don't use  them so it's kind of like the flash it's  not the flashcards that are useless it's  the implementation of them when you do  it this way you have stuff that you  learn very logically and then you have a  small percentage of things that you  can't learn logically those rote  learning things that you just need to  memorize that you can't put on a mind  map that falls into flashcard territory  and then you need to do those when  they're due the problem is that most  people put everything onto flashcards  and that's not sustainable because then  you have thousands of flashcards and you  never have time to do them whereas if  you do it this way you only end up  having 10 to 15 flashcards  lecture for example because you realize  that there is very few things that you  need to actually learn at a high school  level I almost think flashcards and not  necessary because there are so little  information that you need to learn so by  the way you know that standard I was  talking about before that it worked for  you in the past well probably half of my  students that I've been coaching for a  number of months they can finish the  entire year thirteen high school  curriculum a matter of two or three  weeks of self-study and they'll probably  get all excellence at the end of that  and most students that I work was can  reach that level where they can study an  entire year thirteen curriculum and  three weeks or so so normally I say I  usually give them about one or two days  per topic to study so that I mean that's  kind of wait it's very possible like  it's very doable to reach that level I  really think most people are able to  reach that academic ability the thing is  that the current academic system is kind  of created for people that don't know  how to study and so the standard is set  really low like the bar is hella low for  academic standards so if you just know  how to study better than 99% of people  which takes 4% better technique you  instantaneously pretty much surpass or  academic challenge you know in the  formal curriculum Johanna asked how to  know which points are important to write  in the notes so good question again so  there's four different lay layers that I  separated into and this this is a topic  that I'm gonna be going over in a lot  more detail in the course but the first  layer is logical understanding the  second is concepts that are associated  with that logical understanding and then  the second part are important details  that are specific but anchor in those  concepts that you learn it bitter and in  the final layer is just specific details  that aren't really very important so you  divide it in that way so you focus on  logic first you identify which concepts  are associated with this logic you  rearrange it that way you focus in on  understanding those concepts you anchor  them in with important details and  specifics and then you just sprinkle the  remaining specific details on top check  them in flashcards and memorize that  any questions that you guys had this is  a problem that I sometimes have which is  use it just read and then after reading  like write it down is when I read I like  don't really read I just I don't know  that passively read that's actually I  can't concentrate yeah I don't know that  that's actually the term it's called  passive reading what you're doing so  there's two different types of reading  this passive reading and this act of  reading passive reading is just as  useless as passive note-taking so when  you're reading you always want to be  active reading always always always want  to be active reading so when before you  even read a paragraph in your head think  why am i reading this and what am I  trying to get out of it so there is a  question that's being answered so it has  meaning so think about this like just  think about how weird it is that you're  putting yourself artificially in a  position where you are just consuming  information that you feel no relevance  to for no real reason other than to sit  a test compared to how our brain has  evolved to actually work which is a very  intuitive problem-solving machine it has  a problem it clicks information and  consumes information in order to solve a  problem and to you know fill a gap and  knowledge so before you've read you need  to identify the gap what's the gap  you're trying to fill and then look for  information to fill it once it's filled  don't go on to continue passively  reading think okay where now what's my  next gap where am I going with this  what do I want to know from the  information and then again you start  reading and sometimes that means that  you're reading out of order but actually  that's better  so active reading is a very engaging  process it's like if you like if you  just discovered that your parents are  like not your parents and then you've  just uncovered like a news clip clipping  from like 40 years ago and you're trying  to like figure out who your real parents  are you're gonna be hunting through  every single detail and you know every  day and every name is gonna have a  different meaning because you  so driven and inquisitive to filling  that problem that that very detective II  kind of mentality as what you should be  thinking while you study some my  students that struggle to do that I  actually say as soon as you feel like  you're entering the passive reading stop  get up walk around until you have a gap  or a problem and then only when you have  the gap do you sit back down and start  reading because otherwise it trains your  brain to be okay with passive reading  and that's not a good you know condition  conditioning situation that you want to  be in yeah that's very different to  helping you read yeah so all of it  should be quite more a bit more active  not Nicole just asked how do you know  what details you missed out when you  write minimal notes you know what  details you missed out because it  doesn't make sense in your head first so  if it makes sense in your head first you  put it down and if that makes sense and  it's all good and you cushion it and you  challenge it and you're still being very  curious then and and all of that seems  to be pretty well represented then  that's fine you've got it the remaining  stuff that in your course guide or  lecture material or whatever you're  studying that isn't on there you then  find a way to make sense of it by  connecting it by sweeping through and  seeing what you missed or if it still  doesn't make sense you check those are  flashcards so you should never really  miss anything  realistically because you'll always comb  through it again and remember studying  happens in multiple iterations so if you  missed it on the first time you're gonna  pick it up the next week when you do  your weekly revision with mind maps so  Celine says with mind maps would you say  the same for layers apply to what info  you should include on it how would you  structure a good mind map so I've got a  YouTube video about mind maps and it's a  bit of a long topic so I'm not gonna go  into that in a lot of dips at the moment  but I would just say make sure to  represent the mental understanding not  not relying on the notes so you're not  writing the notes for the sake of the  notes you're just representing how it  looks like in your head first if your  mind map is messy it means it's not  clean in your head have it super clean  very organized  very clear very simplified in your head  so you're like I got it I understand it  and I just want to document my thinking  that's the mind man  does it still apply for more  mathematical subjects yes it does  maths is a really different it's  actually the same process but you have  to just apply it on a deeper level so  you start applying these why why do why  do these things happen like conceptual  layer level of thinking to the equations  and the theorems behind maths and then  the details become examples in cases  that you apply afterwards any other  questions send them through what will  party be on this for another live stream  for another ten ten fifteen fifteen  minutes at most so if you guys have any  other questions as well  [Music]  what about um sort of like tips to  overcome perfectionism because even if I  had my like a mind map or something I  always have a tendency to try and make  it look perfect or like pretty yeah so I  know that it wastes time because I'm  noise I don't like this I'll just like  start it again or something yeah so I'm  a friction Asst I'm a perfectionist and  I hold myself to a very high standard  that my standards are so high that I  pretty much just assume that I'll really  never ever reach them you know and  anyone that really knows when a personal  level will know that there are times I  can get very involved in something to  just perfect it like when I'm working on  a website like I will spend hours to get  a pixel perfect when no one else will  notice except for me and like I  legitimately a few days ago spent three  hours figuring out how to make a corner  look rounded instead of square and no  one else would have cared but where are  you directing that perfectionism so  perfectionism is formed from an  insecurity why do you insecure about I'm  insecure about spending a hundred hours  studying to get 10 hours of knowledge  I'm insecure about the fact that I can't  be perfect in other areas of my life  that I want to be I'm insecure  about the fact that I don't want to be  riding out 40 pages of notes and then  get to the time I said a test and just  not know anything or that I'm reading  and then I'm using my brain at a 3.5  percent capacity that's what I am  insecure about and so my notes are quite  neat actually and they look pretty good  because I spend time to like make it  pretty but it's still minimalistic and  it's that when I look at it I'm just  like this is a perfect representation of  my mind and that satisfies me and I  think there is so little clutter this is  clean this knowledge does not give me  joy I've been that and I look at my mind  map at end of it I just think like this  is like this is good learning like this  was a really good study session I was  very focused my notes are clean I was  spending my time well that elements I do  have a very clear and easy to understand  my arrows are distinct and clear and  dynamic my points are well aligned the  logical flow is perfect and can't be  simplified any more so when I look at  other people's notes and they're super  comprehensive and they're really linear  and long I guess so dissatisfied looking  at that it's like it's like if you're a  master painter and then you just see  someone just throwing paint at a wall  and then they're like every aspect is  covered and it's just like dripping and  disgusting and it's just like can slow  clap for you right so just direct that  perfectionism to something that actually  matters because you're not perfectionist  about everything right when you brush  your teeth do you get like a convict a  concave mirror like magnify on every  single crevice to make sure that you've  removed like every molecule of plaque it  was like you know you're not you're not  a perfectionist about everything you  just put perfectionist about the things  that you care about so what I'm saying  is care less about I'm studying and care  more about I need to learn  advice on sleep sleep is another big  topic and it's probably a bit too much  to go over in this current video it's a  good question but um the only the  biggest piece of advice I would say is  have good sleep hygiene look that up  have a good sleep routine and make sure  that you never compromise on sleep  because especially if you're studying  you want to have good sleep because of a  phenomenon called  sleep dependent memory consolidation  which is the time when learned  information is consolidated from parts  of your brain that store information  more short-term and then put it into the  higher-level cortices where you can then  apply and use it and understand it at a  higher level so without sleep that  process is incredibly slow and and  sometimes just straight up doesn't  happen Joanna just says should we read  through all points only then we write  our notes or write at one buy run one by  one depends on how much discomfort you  can handle I try to just do as much as  possible before I write down anything  but that calming light disappeared on my  screen I don't know what happened but  anyway but if you if you can tolerate  taking a little bit more discomfort read  a bit more those are a bit more points  before you put it down let's say that  you were to go to a lecture now how  would you take notes  what would you just I don't know  annotate the slide make any sense  because the slides don't reflect your  understanding the slides are not how you  know it in your head the slides aren't  how you understand it when you think of  the topic you don't think of the slides  and a three page you know three slide  page and annotation doesn't reflect how  the concepts interact there's no  connection it hasn't been made since you  can't simplify it so annotating slides  becomes like everyone one of the most  passive ways of studying so I wouldn't  do that at all  I would before the lecture prime my  knowledge so I have a basic idea of the  overall framework and then I'll take my  basic mind map with a basic skeletal  framework into the lecture  and test that logic and start adding on  to it concepts and important details and  I would try to connect it and simplify  it  they speak I hold on to it I hold on to  it I hold on to it I try to connect I  simplify I'm constantly in my head  applying and simplifying and getting it  convincing it's an analogy I give us  like when you're playing like bejeweled  or like candy crush or something and you  line everything up and it just gets like  you know like it just compresses down  you know  well like it becomes like a really  shining like electrified one and you  like click that and then it just like  deletes the whole column in row like  that's what I try to do in my head with  a knowledge how can I make this piece of  information line up with other pieces of  information in such a way that it really  just becomes one thing rather than four  things and how can I make it so that  this one thing is really pretty much  just an extension of something I already  knew and that's what I'm constantly  doing in my head and that simplified  understanding at some point I feel like  I can't hold on to it anymore  I put it on my mindmap so it's the same  process in my head as when I'm reading  information and that makes sense because  it's simply two different modes of  consuming information  I either consume information through my  eyes or I consume information through my  eyes and ears but what goes in onto my  head is organizing reorganizing and  constructing that information so there's  there's not really much difference and  that's why at the end of it I don't know  any of the specific details I've missed  half the important details but I've got  a really good understanding of the logic  and the concepts and some of the  important details and so I just need to  spend an additional hour mopping up the  rest so then in that case though like I  mean I don't know if it's like this for  you mister but the reason I actually  annotate my notes is because I'm scared  I'm gonna miss something that the  lecturer yes if it's not on the slide so  when you when you do you prime before  the lecture I have started in the last  two weeks well yeah so priming takes  away a lot of that because you know  what's available and the other resources  even just recognizing like oh yeah  they're talking about this and I know  that then the textbook somewhere like  that cuts away a lot of that already if  there are specific things that the  lecturer says that you think might not  be anywhere else on any other resource  while you study then yes you can write  that down but usually that's very  minimal like the  be licious with they might not say  anything that fits that criteria most  people will get a little bit too  overboard with that so you know just  have a focus on that so you can write  those sorts of things down but it's it  usually doesn't end up being much at all  Natasha Tye asks how do you learning  styles visual auditory kinesthetic  affect our note-taking or reading it  doesn't learning styles is a myth  there's no such thing as learning styles  there's lots of studies done on this go  look it up on wire learning styles is a  myth there was a company a long time ago  called vaak which stood for visual  auditory reading right kinesthetic who  made royalties off of selling a quiz  that tests you on your learning style  and gives you a learning style and it  was really popular back in the day but  now they just a struggling company  trying to remain relevant so that's  pretty much just learning pseudoscience  so there's no such thing as really  learning styles the best way to learn is  to learn use all learning styles so like  multimodal learning is the best way to  learn all the time always for everything  because it uses more of your brain it  just forces it into more different  cortices so everything you learn learn  it at all the different ways and when  you revise it mix those up and that's  how you can create lots of different  variations of revision just by changing  those variables around so if you think  I'm a visual learner I'm a dis learner  you're wrong when you talk about  reviewing your notes in the following  week how would you schedule what to  review each week and when you review is  it like reading them I met without  looking yeah so whenever you review just  used recall or reconstruction techniques  so there's a lot of people know about  recognition versus recall recognition is  saying what is this it's a cup recall  would be like saying draw that cup how  well can you draw it recall is obviously  much harder recognition is virtually  useless so it doesn't really have any  place in revision so try to do only  recall based learning or if possible  take it to the next level which is  reconstruction reconstruction is saying  that you have multiple components to the  learning and then you not only can  recall each component but you're able to  reconstruct it in such a way that you  even are changing the order of things  around and  in a way that makes sense so you are  actively taking knowledge and applying  it in different ways and abstracting on  the information different to how you  learned it originally and that's even at  an even higher level so all revision  just try to do it that way  what do you revise each week you just  revise whatever you you learnt that  previous week so just try to make a  schedule while you're revising it on the  day a couple days later one week later a  month later and then two months later  how's apply when learning languages  learning languages a little bit  different language learning is a skill  and skill learning means take the  shortest possible path towards applying  the skill as possible and just do a  constant learning loop so learn just  enough to apply the skill as quickly as  possible  apply the skill and then reflect on what  you need to improve on and then just  consistently do that loop spend as  little time learning as you can and as  much time getting to getting to the  application as possible how to arrange  our time for revision when we have too  much homework and outside tuition well  number one get rid of outside tuition  because it's a waste of money time  resources it takes away your ability to  think by yourself and if you or your  parents don't like it you either say  screw you yourself or screw you your  parents and then cancel it don't show up  to tuition or begrudgingly go and try  not to listen to them or if you need to  do it anyway just milk them for  information but don't rely on it if  you're spending time getting tuition to  be spoon-fed something you're literally  paying someone to teach you something  that you could learn yourself because  you can't learn it yourself I would be  more concerned about the fact that you  can't learn it yourself how do you  arrange time for revision if you've got  too much other stuff use micro learning  techniques and I've got a video called  bursts studying use that because we're  studying is designed so that you can  study in short intervals and get a lot  of work done in a short period of time  final questions how do you transition  from one-dimensional learning to writing  listen utilizing two dimensional  learning so that's talking about doing  mind maps you transition from one  dimensional and it's a top fan so I'm  gonna be a top answer one dimensional  learning to two dimensional learning you  have to most of that process happens  your mind is that when you're actually  learning you have to really actively be  trying to spatially arranged concepts in  your head and make room and see how it  flows together and so when you start  doing this type of note-taking you will  naturally because you know it needs to  be out put it that way anyway you'll  start thinking in that sort of style and  that will really help clear things up  because often when we learn we kind of  have a vague understanding of it but  it's hard to be specific and explicit  enough about where it sits in our  knowledge to be very clear about like  where we want to put it this will force  us to put it somewhere and really refine  those connections with mind maps is it  good to make a big mind map combining  key topics yes or is it good to make  smaller mind maps about it no yeah so  the bigger the better especially when  you're learning at a lower level so like  when you're learning really easy basic  stuff like like high school material  then there's so little concepts in a  single class or a single block that once  you do it this way you'll realize that  this entire class is talking about one  quarter of one concept and it's like  impossible to actually portray that so  you have to do an entire topic all at  once where you have four or five  concepts and six or seven important  details other questions you guys I think  it's just doing it now yeah yeah the  methods to go in between from where  you're comfortable to where you want to  be and it's just a matter of actually  doing it yeah and it's very doable if  you take it in small steps right yeah it  appears that way yeah so just just just  do whatever you feel is gonna be  sustainable like you know the steps that  I outline when I say reduce the amount  of words that you use you know it's up  to your discretion about how much  discomfort you're gonna tolerate to make  it sustainable you might only be  reducing your words by like one word per  sentence and that's dual progress and  then you might reduce it by two where  you know so on and so forth so just you  know Confucius it'll someone said if you  fall on your face you're still moving  forward so you know just focus  any amount of marginal gain give you a  little bit of time to think of questions  any other questions on Facebook leave  them in the comments this is a last call  any questions that don't come through in  the next minute you have to wait till  the next study clinic or comb through  all the other videos that we have well  maybe a question that the audience might  like is how often do normally do these  study clinics things yeah I've actually  been asked that a lot  I've actually asked that every single  day I don't know it's it's really  infrequent I at the moment what's this  whole Facebook page and my channels and  Instagram and things I pretty much just  do things whenever I feel like people  will tune in so like if I did a study  clinic tomorrow I just feel like not  many people would watch so I wouldn't do  one and then after a certain amount of  time I feel like oh yeah people will  probably watch if I do another one and  that's kind of when I do it I'm probably  gonna get into doing a study clinic once  every fortnight or once a month and then  a DM C once a month because I also have  private study clinics I do like  one-on-one with people and I do one of  those usually like once a week or so it  just depends on the load because these  days I get about 12 or 15 messages a day  from people wanting specific study  advice and it feels mean to like leave  them hanging for like a month to do  another study clinic which is why I do  them this frequently but um yeah just  keep an eye out in the future and also  the more people that are joining in and  the more people that are contributing  the more incentivize I'll be to do more  of them and so that means you know  everyone should be tagging and inviting  all of their friends hey if you've got  like 500 friends on Facebook and you  click invite all friends and there's  like 40-something people watching at the  moment so that's a lot of potential new  followers to really incentivize me  otherwise I may never do one of these  again that's right I mean I did share  this is my Facebook and I think a few of  my friends are watching I think so  because people are saying hi Joanna says  and this is probably the final quiz  and Joanna says which environment is  suitable for studying again it's a big  topic the environment doesn't matter so  much as the factors in the environment  which you usually can modify and control  so experiment and think about what are  the things in your environment that you  need in order to maintain focus and then  implement those within your focus zone  and you will notice that there are  certain trends and also that this will  change as you get older or more  experienced and you will realize that  you can study in some weird situations  because you can modify a few of those  factors like you can study on the bus  you can study in various different  places and another thing is leverage  technology in order to enable you to do  this so simple things like for example  wearing headphones and earphones and  playing white noise and things like that  but for example if you get motion sick  like I do on the bus or in the car doing  flashcards or whatever install like a  motion a motion sickness app on your  phone which creates an artificial  horizon for you to look at and that gets  rid of motion sickness so there's  actually a lot of ways that you can look  for where a situation where technology  is so advanced in this way that if you  just look for something to solve a  problem there might be something there  and they can do that  Vishakha says any thoughts on studying  when tired yes many thoughts about that  don't I think it's basically with the  whole sorry cuz you're just like  everything is all about active learning  and stuff because that is obviously the  best way to learn but like being tired  really challenges yeah three different  types of tired  there's the tutor two to five pm tired  where you just like will fall asleep no  matter what you're doing and in that  case you're gonna realize the  alternative to being like you know you  can if you're gonna fall asleep that's  zero percent productivity so doing  something that's even 1% productive is  an improvement so in so a lot of people  will try to just modify their current  studying to be more engaging so they  don't fall asleep don't do that find the  thing that's definitely gonna keep you  awake and modify that to be more  productive so even if you're only  getting at  like if you're not gonna fall asleep by  going for a jog go for a jog and then  maybe listen to a podcast or just go  through a mental mind map in your head  and even if you only get 1% learning out  of that it was actually better than the  alternative which was nothing so that's  one type of tired the other type of  tired is like I've been studying for a  long-ass time type of tired and in that  situation I recommend watching my video  about work wrist breaks and how to take  effective breaks because I cover that  topic in more depth and I've got another  video coming up either tomorrow or in a  couple days about that specific topic as  well about how to take effective breaks  and I've really recommend I'm watching  that  if you're a parent and you're always  tired well actually you know a lot of my  clients and a lot of people I'm students  that I work with are parents and  actually a lot of them are a single  parents as well there's always a way if  you use active techniques like micro  learning if you and that's another  reason why being able to learn in your  head without needing to write notes are  so effective because you can do it  pretty much any way like you can be in  the shower and be studying more  effectively than someone that's in the  library right fully legitimately so  we're past in how I now if you've got  any other questions you have to save it  up for the next study clinic any final  questions or anything that you wanted to  say thank you yeah just thanks oh great  I'm glad you found it useful thanks for  coming in and joining on this this will  be available as a recording and I'll  also be cutting up snippets of it of  some of the highlighted most important  parts and chucking them on Facebook and  Instagram over the next month or so just  for people that missed it so yeah thanks  everyone for tuning in and see you on  the next DMC your clinic thanks guys  thank you thanks yeah
